# Documentation for My React Project

#### <mark style="color:red;">**Project Overview**</mark>

The project is a simple landing page that serves as an entry point to a platform offering various products. The landing page includes a footer, a title, and three buttons. Each button leads to a different category of products: books, video games, and other general products. The "Video Games" button opens a page that implements everything learned in the ReactJS course, including state management, routing, and data fetching using React Query.

***

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**Technologies Used**</mark>_

* **React.js.**
* **React Query.**
* **React Router.**
* **Context API.**
* **Axios** for API calls.
* **Zustand** (for global state management).
*

    ***

#### **Project Structure**

1. **Landing Page**\
   The main page consists of:
   * A header with the title.
   * A footer.
   * Three buttons: "Books," "Video Games," and "Other Products."
2. **Video Games Page**
   * Displays a list of video games fetched from an API using React Query.
   * Includes features like pagination, error handling, loading indicators, and dynamic queries.
   * Utilizes React Context for state management and React Router for navigation.

***

#### **Course Concepts Applied in the Project**

**1. Fetching and Updating Data with React Query**

* **Introduction to React Query**\
  React Query was used to handle all data-fetching, caching, and state management related to video games. It abstracts away many complexities like handling loading states, error handling, and caching.
*   **Example Code:**

    ```
    // Use React Query to fetch video games
    const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(['games'], fetchGames);
    ```
*   **Handling Errors:** We handled errors using React Query's built-in error mechanism.

    ```
    if (error) {
      return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
    }
    ```
*   **Loading Indicator:** A loading spinner or message was displayed while data was being fetched.

    ```
    if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    ```
*   **Parameterized Queries:** The query to fetch video game data was parameterized by the game's ID.

    ```
    function useGame(id) {
      return useQuery(['game', id], () => fetchGameById(id));
    }
    ```
*   **Pagination:** Used for fetching large datasets like video games, allowing for paginated results.

    ```
    function usePaginatedGames(page) {
      return useQuery(['games', page], fetchGames, { keepPreviousData: true });
    }
    ```
*   **Optimistic Updates:** Optimistic UI updates were implemented for adding new video games.

    ```
    function useOptimisticAddGame() {
      return useMutation(
        (newGame) => axios.post('https://api.example.com/games', newGame),
        {
          onMutate: async (newGame) => {
            // Optimistic UI update logic
          },
          onError: (error, newGame, context) => {
            // Rollback in case of error
          },
          onSettled: () => {
            // Refetch data after mutation
          },
        }
      );
    }
    ```

**2. Global State Management**

* **React Context API:**\
  NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
*   **Example Code:**

    ```
    const MyContext = createContext();

    function MyProvider({ children }) {
      const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
      return (
        <MyContext.Provider value={{ state, setState }}>
          {children}
        </MyContext.Provider>
      );
    }
    ```
*   **Using Zustand for Global State:**\
    Zustand was used for state management to avoid unnecessary renders and improve performance.

    ```
    const useStore = create((set) => ({
      games: [],
      addGame: (game) => set((state) => ({ games: [...state.games, game] })),
    }));
    ```

***

**3. Routing with React Router**

* **Setting Up Routing:** React Router was used to manage page navigation. The "Video Games" button leads to a separate page where the list of games is displayed.
*   **Example Code:**

    ```
    <Route path="/games" component={GamesPage} />
    ```
*   **Private Routes:**\
    We created a private route for users to access their account information, ensuring only authenticated users can access that route.

    ```
    <PrivateRoute path="/account" component={AccountPage} />
    ```
*   **Nested Routes:**\
    Nested routes were used for displaying game details on the same page.

    ```
    <Route path="/games/:gameId" component={GameDetailPage} />
    ```

#### **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the application of key ReactJS concepts learned from the course, including data fetching with React Query, state management with React Context and Zustand, and routing with React Router. The platform provides a smooth user experience for browsing products such as books and video games, and it can be extended with additional features like authentication and user preferences.
